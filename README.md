ABSTRACT

This is a Java E-Commerce App with Net Beans IDE that based on classes and object orinted programming mentality. There are four classes, and each class have special methods. Name of classes are; User, Product, Order, CreditCard and Test. User class is for generating users and it is pretending like main class. Also it is directly communicating with Order and CreditCard classes. Because order is making individually by user. And credit cards are defined with their owner. Users can making order and adding removing favourite product processes. And these processes are held on ArrayLists to call them after. Credit card section and some of methods like “findMostOrderedProduct(),
writeOrderList()”. Product class, is for generating products and it holds the information about products. Also it has tasks about stock checking and reducing stock amount. Order class is connected with user class and owner of order. After user make an order, methods of order class are calling at the same time. CreditCard class is holding information about credit cards but it is not connected with balance and account it is symbolic and improveable. Finally, we have Test class which is for creating objects with their referer and test their methods from another classes. Also main method is in the Test class to run the project.
